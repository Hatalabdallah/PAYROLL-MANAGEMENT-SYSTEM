# PAYROLL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

Online Employee Payroll Management System Project
Pay slips are provided to the employees to record their monthly pay and allowances. It is a document that provides the employees with details of their incomes and deductions as it would differ from employee to employee. Manual salary slips are outdated, now as most of them work in technology using companies and the pdf file of a salary slip is received on salary day. Issuing manual salary slip and HRMS system might be time-consuming and might consume a lot of paper. We propose an online human resource and payroll management system project which helps in generating salary of the employees every month without worries. This HR payroll software will help in distribution of pay slips to employees and also helps to manage employee information efficiently. This payroll system has one HR module. HR can add all the employees by filling their personal details, their salary details and leave bifurcation. HR can upload Monthly Attendance excel File of each Employee. Then salary calculation and leave management will be done automatically by this leave management system on the basis of salary details and attendance details provided by the HR. Then the salary slip will be generated and it will auto mail the pay slips to all the employees. HR can also manage employee details like updating new details of existing employee, add new employees and deleting the employee details who has left the company.

• Modules:
The system comprises of 1 major module with their sub-modules as follows:
    1. HR:

Project Lifecycle:

Description
The waterfall Model is a linear sequential flow. In which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of software implementation. This means that any phase in the development process begins only if the previous phase is complete. The waterfall approach does not define the process to go back to the previous phase to handle changes in requirement. The waterfall approach is the earliest approach that was used for software development.
